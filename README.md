# LLM-Based-Code-Comment-Summarization

## About
This repository provides an implementation of code comment summarization using LLM-based summarizer, as described in the paper:
**LLM-Based Code Comment Summarization: Efficacy Evaluation and Challenges** 

To support software developers in understanding and maintaining a software system, various techniques used for code summarization and related tasks have been proposed, including LLM-based code summarization. Code comment is one of the communication channels and practices that can assist developers in developing and maintaining software systems. Interpreting and understanding code comments can be a challenging task. This research investigates the efficacy of applying large language models to identify SATD (Self-Admitted Technical Debt) and summarize the code comments containing SATD to support code maintenance.

The findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using pre-trained LLMs for code comments summarization, paving the way for future improvements in this domain.
